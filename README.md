			# AirBnB Clone - The Console
The following project is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone, and it focuses on creating a command-line interpreter to manage the project's objects.

	## Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter allows us to perform various operations on AirBnB objects. To get started:

	## Starting the command interpreter:
Run the following command, to start the command interpreter:
	$ ./console.py

	## Using the command interpreter:
Once you start the command interpreter, you can use the consequent commands:
	- "help": Displays the list of available commands and their descriptions.
	- "quit": Exits the command interpreter.

	## Command interpreter examples:
The following are some examples that shows how to use a command interpreter:
	1- Get help:
	...
	(hbnb) help
	...
	2- Quit the command interpreter:
	...
	(hbnb) quit
	...

			# Project information
The AirBnB clone project involves different steps, to get to the end result. The first part is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between the objects and how they're stored and persisted. This abstraction will also allows us to change the type of storageeasily without updating the whole of our codebase.

	The making of the console involves:
	- Creating our data model.
	- Managing objects via a command interpreter.
	- Storing and persisting objects to a file.
